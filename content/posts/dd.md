# DigitalDevices Drivers

## Automatic Installation

For installation by script just launch command:

```
curl http://cesbo.com/download/astra/scripts/drv-dd.sh | bash
```

## Manual Installation

### Prepare system

To install drivers needed root privileges:

```
sudo -s
```

Install system utilities to build drivers from the source code:

```
apt-get install build-essential \
    patchutils \
    libproc-processtable-perl \
    linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Remove old media drivers:

```
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/media
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/staging/media
```

### Install

Download latest driver from the official repository:

```
git clone -b 0.9.37 --depth=1 https://github.com/DigitalDevices/dddvb /usr/src/dddvb
cd /usr/src/dddvb
```

Build drivers and install it:

```
make
make install
```

Update dirver dependencies:

```
mkdir -p /etc/depmod.d
echo 'search extra updates built-in' | tee /etc/depmod.d/extra.conf
depmod -a
```

Create driver configuration for DigitalDevices MaxS8:

```
echo 'options ddbridge fmode=0' | tee /etc/modprobe.d/ddbridge.conf
```

For MaxS8 available next `fmode` values instead of `0`:

- `fmode=0` - 4 tuner mode (internal multiswitch disabled)
- `fmode=1` - Quad LNB / normal outputs of multiswitches
- `fmode=2` - Quattro - LNB / cascade outputs of multiswitches
- `fmode=3` - Unicable LNB or JESS / Unicabel output of the multiswitch

## Restart System

To launch installed drivers restart your system:

```
shutdown -r now
```

After reboot check adapters:

```
ls /dev/dvb
```

Should be listed all adapters installed in the system. For example:

```
adapter0 adapter1 adapter2 adapter3 adapter4 adapter5 adapter6 adapter7
```

## Troubleshooting

??? question "All works fine until server reboot"

    Probably Linux kernel has been updated with autoupdate or manually. Try to reinstall driver.

??? question "DVB adapters are not available"

    If command `ls /dev/dvb` shows error `No such file or directory`, then first of all need to check is hardware is visible in the system:

    ```
    lspci | grep Multimedia
    ```

    If adapters connected to the PCIe properly you will see listing of the PCIe adapters. For example:

    ```
    01:00.0 Multimedia controller: Digital Devices GmbH Cine V7
    ```

    Try to reinstall driver. If this not helps, please contact with hardware vendor.

??? question "Signal is fine, but channels not working"

    Check dmesg output for i2c errors:

    ```
    dmesg | grep i2c
    ```

    if you see messages like `i2c_write error` then turn off MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) in the driver:

    Open `/etc/modprobe.d/ddbridge.conf` in any text editor. Find line `options ddbridge`.
    After the `ddbridge` append `msi=0` option. For example: `options ddbridge msi=0 fmode=1`.
