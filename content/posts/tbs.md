# TBS Drivers

## Automatic Installation

For installation by script just launch command:

```
curl http://cesbo.com/download/astra/scripts/drv-tbs.sh | bash
```

## Manual Installation

### Prepare system

To install drivers needed root privileges:

```
sudo -s
```

Install system utilities to build drivers from the source code:

```
apt-get install build-essential \
    patchutils \
    libproc-processtable-perl \
    linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
    git
```

Remove old media drivers:

```
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/media
rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/staging/media
```

### Install

Download latest driver from the official repository:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tbsdtv/media_build.git /usr/src/media_build
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tbsdtv/linux_media.git -b latest /usr/src/media
cd /usr/src/media_build
```

Build drivers and install it:

```
make dir DIR=../media
make allyesconfig
make
make install
```

Install firmware for DVB adapters:

```
curl -L http://www.tbsdtv.com/download/document/linux/tbs-tuner-firmwares_v1.0.tar.bz2 | tar -C /lib/firmware/ -jxf -
```

## Restart System

To launch installed drivers restart your system:

```
shutdown -r now
```

After reboot check adapters:

```
ls /dev/dvb
```

Should be listed all adapters installed in the system. For example:

```
adapter0 adapter1 adapter2 adapter3 adapter4 adapter5 adapter6 adapter7
```

## Troubleshooting

??? question "All works fine until server reboot"

    Probably Linux kernel has been updated with autoupdate or manually. Try to reinstall driver.

??? question "DVB adapters are not available"

    If command `ls /dev/dvb` shows error `No such file or directory`, then first of all need to check is hardware is visible by the system:

    ```
    lspci | grep Multimedia
    ```

    If adapters connected to the PCIe properly you will see listing of the PCIe adapters. For example:

    ```
    01:00.0 Multimedia controller: TBS Technologies DVB-S2 4 Tuner PCIe Card
    ```

    Try to reinstall driver. If this not helps, please contact with hardware vendor.
